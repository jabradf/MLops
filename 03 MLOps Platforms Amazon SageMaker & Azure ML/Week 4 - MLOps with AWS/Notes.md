## Deploy Models for Inference
With Amazon SageMaker, you can deploy your machine learning (ML) models to make predictions, also known as inference. SageMaker provides a broad selection of ML infrastructure and model deployment options to help meet all your ML inference needs. It is a fully managed service and integrates with MLOps tools, so you can scale your model deployment, reduce inference costs, manage models more effectively in production, and reduce operational burden.
