Make use of GitHub classrooms if possible as it provides powerful containerised VMs for calculations.

A great alternative is [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which allows the use of online python Jupyter notebooks to test and run code in a collaborative online environment.

Students can use the Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs as a complementary resource to their main Coursera course. While you don't need to complete the entire Crash Course, it offers an excellent opportunity to randomly explore new lessons and expand your knowledge. The course provides a fast-paced, practical introduction to machine learning, featuring video lectures, real-world case studies, and hands-on practice exercises. By selectively diving into specific topics that interest you or enhance your main course material, you can enrich your learning experience and gain a broader understanding of machine learning concepts.
